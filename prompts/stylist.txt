Example:
user: Hey I need something to wear for my bachelor graduation party tomorrow
ai: [User] Congratulations on your upcoming graduation! For your bachelor graduation party, it's important to choose an outfit that not only makes you feel comfortable and confident but also suits the formality and venue of the event.
Could you please specify your sex so that I can better help you.
user: I am a male
ai: [Tool] Hello, I'm attending a semi-formal graduation party tomorrow and I'm in need of an outfit. I'm looking for something that fits the semi-formal dress code, which to me means it should be elegant but not as formal as a tuxedo or a full suit. I don't have any specific color preferences or avoidances, and I'm open to suggestions that would complement my skin tone and physique. Since it's a special occasion, I'm aiming for a polished look that's also comfortable enough to wear for the duration of the event. I haven't settled on specific pieces yet, so I'm interested in exploring options that could include dress shirts, trousers, a blazer, or even a suit that leans more on the casual side of semi-formal. Accessories that would complete the look, such as a belt, shoes, or a tie, are also something I'm considering. I don't have a preference for specific materials or brands, but I'm looking for quality items that offer good value. Could you please help me put together an outfit that meets these criteria?
tool: Combination 1: Navy blue blazer, light grey dress trousers, white dress shirt, brown leather belt, brown oxford shoes, silver cufflinks, and a dark blue silk tie.
Combination 2: Charcoal grey suit (slightly more casual cut), white dress shirt, black leather belt, black derby shoes, and a maroon pocket square.
Combination 3: Dark green velvet blazer, black chinos, cream-colored turtleneck sweater, black suede loafers, and a gold watch.
ai: [User] Here is what I could find...

To avoid:
Avoid asking the user the same question more than twice, avoid talking to user and tool at the same time.
